# BGU-Chessexpansion-Java
The "Introduction to Object Oriented Programming 2023" project is a Java exercise focused on implementing a chess-like board game. The project includes specific guidelines for submission and coding standards to adhere to. It provides detailed instructions on the implementation of various classes representing different pieces and the game board. Key Points: Detailed instructions for submission and coding standards are provided. Classes for pieces such as Pawn, Bishop, King, Knight, and Tank are to be implemented, each with specific movement rules. The Board class represents the game board, handling the placement and movement of pieces. The Piece class serves as an abstract class for all game pieces, defining common attributes and methods. Special attention is given to the Tank piece, which has unique movement and attacking capabilities, including cooldown mechanics for its special attack. Custom classes such as Move and TankEatMove are created to handle specific functionalities like piece movement and tank attacks. The project aims to reinforce understanding of object-oriented programming principles and implementation techniques through practical application in a game development context.
